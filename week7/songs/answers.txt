If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would characterize their audio aura as cheerful but not very attractive because the scores are 0.72 for danceability, 0.66 for energy and 0.48 for valence.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
It might not an accurate representation of the listener because it is taking an average of those data types, where the data set could have a large deviation such as only 0.1s and 0.9s. A better way of calculating an aura can rely on multiple sets of data by taking the mean, median, mode and standard deviation of the data to consider more cases.
