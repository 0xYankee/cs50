Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The predictions with 10, 100 simulations proved to be incorrect as the output only provided with 6 instead of all 16 teams, this can be due to the fact that the lesser amount of simulations meaning smaller sample size, disallowing a much more accurate prediction to determine the chances of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Around 200,000 simulations, it provided precise data all of the time.
