      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Every single day we are being flooded with news of how cryptocurrency is booming and how NFTs are worth X millions of dollars. If you are reading this, you are either here to know which cryptocurrency to buy or how can you earn money through crypto.</p>
      <p>Before we dive into the different ways to invest your time, energy and money into cryptocurrencies, we need to understand and get a sense of what they are about.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>What is cryptocurrency?</h3>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is just a string of numbers stored on a blockchain. It is generated by algorithms that rely on cryptography, hence the name ‘crypto’ currency.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Are they real? Where do they exist?</h3>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is just software that is created by code. In almost all cases, the code is public and the software is decentralised. The software is hosted on individual computers all over the world, instead of a central server. When cryptocurrency is used as money, the transactions are stored in a secure database called a blockchain.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>What is a blockchain?</h3>
      <p>Blockchain in this use case, serves as a ledger of all the coded transactions, similar to a check book but for cryptocurrency.
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">Imagine a book where you write down on each page the spendings of each day, each page represents a block and the book itself represents a blockchain.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">There are multiple copies of the book and it is stored in different bookshelves which are the computers that stores each copy of the blockchain.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">The interesting part is, if someone was to change a single transaction of the book, we can cross-reference the books to easily pinpoint the falsified information.</li>
        </ul>
        Blockchain technology allows cryptocurrency to achieve:
        <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
          <li class="list-group-item">Immutability<p>Blockchain’s goal is to record and distribute information not edit it. Therefore, each transaction requires validation using consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), etc.</p></li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Decentralization<p>Imagine putting all your information in a central server, it provides a single point of failure. In contrast, putting the same information in different computers that verifies with each other is a better solution.</p></li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Transparency<p>All transactions can be viewed through a blockchain explorer. Therefore, any movement of cryptocurrency can be easily traced.</p></li>
        </ol>
      <hr>
      <h3>Why do we need cryptocurrency?</h3>
      <p>
        <h6>Advantages</h6>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Cryptocurrencies are generally NOT issued by central authorities such as banks, governments, etc. This allows cryptocurrencies to be immune to interference and manipulation, essentially, you are in control of your money.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Cryptocurrencies eliminate the possibility of a single point of failure, such as a bank setting off a cascade of crises.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Cryptocurrencies makes it easier to transfer funds between two parties, without the need of a middleman such as banks or a card company. This form of decentralisation is possible due to how the consensus mechanisms work.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Cryptocurrencies provide faster transactions since there is no middleman. A good example would be to receive a loan in decentralised finance (DeFi); these loans are able to be executed within seconds as compared to banks loans that takes up time to carry out.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Cryptocurrencies allow money to be transferred across borders easily. This method streamlines the money transfer process and makes it cheaper.</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Disadvantages</h6>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">Cryptocurrency transactions claim to be anonymous, but they are actually pseudonymous — they leave a digital trail that can be traced by anyone.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">Cryptocurrency is a tool which criminals use to do money laundering and illicit purchases. However, a blockchain is transparent, therefore such malicious acts are traceable.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">Cryptocurrencies can be obtained by different methods. One of which is through mining, but it poses an environmental threat. Mining uses high energy output through computers with an Internet connection. However, this is only relevant to blockchains with a consensus mechanisms of PoW such as the almighty Bitcoin.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies, they can be hacked. However, there are preventions such as, instead of holding your cryptocurrencies in a hot wallet, you can transfer it to a cold wallet, which is the safest.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>To sum it up, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology brings both end of the stick to the table. Despite having it’s disadvantages, we shouldn’t blindside the game changing technological aspects that it can achieve.</p>
      <p>From an investor point of view, cryptocurrency is decentralised and allows us to have ownership of our own digital assets. I believe cryptocurrency will be here for not just a good time, but for a long time as well.</p>
